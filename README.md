# Should You Be Tempted to Invest in Bitcoin?

## Project Statement:
Bitcoin, a worldwide cryptocurrency invented by an unknown person with alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central repository or single administrator. The coins don’t exist in a tangible form but are made by computers and stored in a digital wallet or on the cloud but there is a finite number of bitcoin that can be supplied i.e. 21million and there are currently 16million in circulation.<br />

Why this topic? Bitcoin price soars above $11000 to a new record high value! This is the headline all news channels were telecasting from the past few days. And the question in everyone's mind is **Will it survive or is it just a bubble?** The value of bitcoin is tied purely to the concept of supply and demand, as the people are getting more aware about it and buying it, the prices are increasing. As we compare to other established currencies and commodities like USD/EURO dollar or gold prices, Bitcoin has been very volatile and also the market for Bitcoin is not regulated as per the laws. Still bitcoin prices are rising wildly, you might be wondering how wild it can be - Seven years ago, two pizzas could be bought for 10,000 bitcoins, which today would be worth $100 million. Demand is increasing, alongside criticism, if you want to get involved in the cryptocurrency then awareness is the key. Therefore, we will be doing a thorough analysis about the benefits and risks involved for a potential investor willing to diversify his/her portfolio of investment and then conclude "Would it be the best use of an investor's money?"

## Audience:
Our targeted audience is a potential investor interested in diversifying his/her existing portfolio of investments. In order to maximize expected return and minimize foreseeable risk inherited in the current industries of his/her investments, the ultimate objective of the mentioned investor is to invest in a industry different than the existing ones, and we are analyzing the positive and negative aspects of investing in crytocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin and "Will it a profitable avenue for the audience to consider investing in?"

### Audience Need:
The Audience is interested in taking profits from the likely arbitrage opportunity embedded in the cryptocurrencies. As we see in the patterns and trends of cryptocurrencies historical prices, there are short-term spikes and upticks in the prices which pose a decent profit making opportunity for prospective investors. Therefore, the immediate of the audience is to diversify their investment portfolio and to reap the benefits of earning sizable profits from investing in a digital currency like Bitcoin.

### Audience Want:
Our presumed audience for this analysis of Bitcoin investment is a prospective investor intending to diversify his/her investments. That particular investor wants to ascertain the positive aspects of investing in cryptocurrencies. The chances of earning a higher profit margin and return on investment as compared to other traditional investments are also part of the wants of our audience. 

### Audience Fears:
Being virtual and digital currencies, Cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government or a regulatory agency and the operations are decentralized as compared to the traditional centralized banking system and the financial markets. Therefore, a general perception and an expected fear of our audience would be the safety, reliability and foreseeability of their investment in cryptocurrencies. Since the legal status of cryptocurrencies still varies from country to country as some of them have yet not legalized its trading, so another audience fear may be the legality and sustainability of investing in the digital currencies.

## Project Progression:
### 1. Data Analysis:

To start with the data analysis, we collected data from 2013 to 2017 about the closing stock prices of Bitcoin and put that into tableau to get an overall picture of trends shown by Bitcoin over the time. The visualization showed, there was an increase in the price of bitcoin in the initial years because people started to get some insight about the cryptocurrency world and started buying and keeping it as an asset but then due to speculations in people’s mind that it is unstable and not legal and can crash anytime, made the prices to go down. After this, 2017 started with a bang as Bitcoin shot through the $1000 mark with no signs of slowing down and it has reached a record breaking mark of above $11000 today.

We collected data about the number of bitcoins in circulation. Above graph shows the increasing number of bitcoins over the years in the market. It has been forecasted that only 21m bitcoin can be generated and 16m bitcoins are already in circulation, so bitcoins are finite in number. But this can also imply that as the bitcoins become scarce, the prices are going to rise, the simple demand and supply mechanism. Higher the demand, more are the prices. 

The reason we focussed on Bitcoin out of all the currencies, is because Bitcoin is the first one to be in the market and lot of people still are not aware of it. So, it would be interesting to see the reason behind its soaring prices and whether it is a safe currency to invest, or should you keep it as a long term asset or is it just a bubble that is soon going to crash?

### 2. Data Wrangling:
To reach a decision, we analyzed some key metrics about the market trends shown by the Bitcoin and other currencies. We have multiple data sets web scraped and downloaded from websites like kaggle.com, quandl.com, coindesk.com etc. We collected datasets about open, high, low, close prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin i.e. all the cryptocurrencies, Nasdaq and S&P Index for Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s comparison to USD/EURO currencies. Also, data about number of transactions per day for Bitcoin and Ethereum(the second best cryptocurrency in the market) to see if there are some exceptions. As cryptocurrencies are also being used as Initial coin offerings by some companies, we collected data about Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s Return on Investment since ICO. <br />
The datasets did not require much cleaning, we renamed some columns and integrated the datasets as per the common attributes and got 3 different datasets in the end. Data sources are mentioned below:<br />
